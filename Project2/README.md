# **Project 2: Shader Creation in Unity**

This project is part of the **Computer Graphics Course** and showcases a shader developed using Unity. The shader is inspired by and adapted from a Shadertoy project. Below, you'll find the steps to use it in Unity, along with attribution details for the original shader.

## **Overview**
This Unity project demonstrates a custom shader that creates visually stunning effects, inspired by the creativity of shaders found on the Shadertoy platform. It's a great starting point for understanding how to integrate shaders in Unity.
