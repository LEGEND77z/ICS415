# Project 3: Minecraft-like Game Engine

## Overview
This project is a simplified Minecraft-like voxel engine implemented using Java and LWJGL. It provides foundational 3D graphics features, including rendering textured cubes, interactive camera movement, block placement, and destruction.

## Features
- **3D Block Rendering:** Displays textured voxel-based cubes.
- **Texture Mapping:** Applies textures from a texture atlas to blocks.
- **Interactive Camera:** WASD and mouse-driven camera navigation.
- **Block Manipulation:** Left-click to remove blocks; right-click to place blocks interactively.
- **Raycasting:** Accurately detects targeted blocks for interaction.

## Technologies Used
- **Java:** Primary programming language.
- **LWJGL:** Lightweight Java Game Library for OpenGL integration.
- **GLFW:** Handles window creation and user input.
- **JOML:** Math library for vector and matrix operations.
- **GLSL Shaders:** Custom shaders for rendering blocks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK 17+)
- LWJGL 3.3.3 or later
- IntelliJ IDEA or similar IDE

### Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/computer-graphics-projects.git
cd computer-graphics-projects/Project3-MinecraftLikeEngine
```
### 2. Open the Project in IntelliJ IDEA

- Launch IntelliJ IDEA  
- Go to `File → Open...`  
- Select the `Project3-MinecraftLikeEngine` folder

### 3. Configure LWJGL Libraries

- Go to `File → Project Structure → Libraries`  
- Click the `+` button → choose **Java**  
- Add all required `.jar` files from your LWJGL download, such as:
  - `lwjgl.jar`
  - `lwjgl-glfw.jar`
  - `lwjgl-opengl.jar`
  - `lwjgl-stb.jar`
  - `joml.jar`
- Also include the native `.jar` file for your OS, e.g.:
  - `lwjgl-natives-windows.jar`
