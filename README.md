# Computer Graphics Course Repository

This repository contains the projects completed for the **Computer Graphics** course.

## Projects Overview

### **Project 1: Ray Tracing Exercise**
This project is based on the ray tracing exercise from the book *Ray Tracing in One Weekend*. It implements foundational concepts of ray tracing and provides an introduction to the principles of rendering.

### **Project 2: Shader Creation**
This project showcases a custom shader developed using **Unity**, inspired by concepts and examples from the **Shadertoy** website. The shader explores creative visual effects and demonstrates advanced shader techniques.

## Project 3: Minecraft-like Engine (BlockStorm)

This project implements a simple 3D voxel engine inspired by Minecraft, developed using Java and LWJGL. It features basic voxel-based world rendering, camera movement, block placement and removal, raycasting for interaction, and texture mapping.
